## Getting Started

We have step up both the frontend as well as the backend folders inside on repository.
However each of these will be hosted by separate entities. So even as you clone the repo, in the case that your PR/MR
has to do with both frontend and backend you will need to run the servers separately

### For the FRONTEND -> Running the Server (Next.JS):

- After you have Cloned the Repo, Run the Commands:
  > `cd agrizolve-frontend` -> To move into the frontend folder
  > `yarn install` or `npm install` -> to install all the packages
  > `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` -> to start the server on a localhost port

### For the BACKEND -> Running the Server (JAVA (SpringBoot / C# / Django)):

- Backend Architecture is yet top be decided. As soon as the lead team has settled on what will complete the stack,
  this section will be updated like wise. However if you want to participate and you feel a certain tool is what we may need
  to make this project a reality the feel free to reach out on the email address: [interwebbbc@gmail.com](mailto:interwebbbc@gmail.com)
